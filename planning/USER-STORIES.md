# User Stories

User A finally gets the job he wants after a long time of searching and failing. He decides to write a message of encouragement so he visits the website, picks a postcard template and writes a little message to his past self that everything would be ok. The sender is anonymous and he can opt to write the recipient as anyone. He goes ahead and posts it.

User B is also having a bad day, she visits the site and browses through the anonymous postcards and happens upon User A's postcard...

User C likes writing random notes throughout the week, a quote they encountered, a rant about work, a happy thought, a sad poem, anything... They sign up as a user at the website and creates multiple posts every week. They feel good just writing out their thoughts, and sometimes they revisit their account and look back at the postcards they made.
