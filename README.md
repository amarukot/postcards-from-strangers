# Postcards from a Stranger || PO Box Zero

Capstone Project for GA Software Engineering Immersive Course.

The idea is to have a website where users can create anonymous postcards/messages/letters to anyone or no one in particular. These postcards could have any message â€“ inspiration, rants, words of advice, or just anything really. I wanted to keep the sender anonymous so that they can be free to express themselves. I also wanted the 'recipients' to not know the senders to make the messages have more meaning to them and interpret them according to their situation.

## Issues

2-18-2020:  
Error on migration of seed data.

```
django.db.utils.DataError: value too long for type character varying(100)
```

Solution: Changed length in database directly (using Postico), not through models.py because that didn't change anything.
