# Postcards from a Stranger || PO Box Zero

Capstone Project for GA Software Engineering Immersive Course.

The idea is to have a website where users can create anonymous postcards/messages/letters to anyone or no one in particular. These postcards could have any message â€“ inspiration, rants, words of advice, or just anything really. I wanted to keep the sender anonymous so that they can be free to express themselves. I also wanted the 'recipients' to not know the senders to make the messages have more meaning to them and interpret them according to their situation.

## Issues

2-18-2020:  
Error on migration of seed data.

```
django.db.utils.DataError: value too long for type character varying(100)
```

Solution: Changed length in database directly (using Postico), not through models.py because that didn't change anything.

2-19-2020:
Trying to deploy using Heroku. Multiple issues, DEBUG=True or False?
Ended up setting it to True, then setting the database entries in settings.py according to config vars in Heroku. Once deployed, will switch back to FALSE.

2-20-2020:  
`Invalid block tag on line 8: 'endblock'. Did you forget to register or load this tag?`  
Solution: `{% load crispy_forms_tags %}` should be right before the `<form>` tags.

2-21-2020:  
Images were not loading if `DEBUG=False` in settings.py.

Tried `python3 manage.py collectstatic` to put all static files into STATIC_ROOT. Didn't work.

Tried to add a key/value entry in Heroku config vars for MEDIA_URL.
Didn't work either.
