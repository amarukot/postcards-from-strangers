# Postcards from a Stranger
Description: 
Capstone Project for GA Software Engineering Immersive Course.

The idea is to have a website where users can send anonymous postcards to strangers. These postcards would have inspirational messages, words of advice, or just anything really. I wanted to keep the sender anonymous so that they can be free to express themselves. I also wanted the 'recipients' to not know the senders to make the messages have more meaning to them and interpret them according to their situation.
